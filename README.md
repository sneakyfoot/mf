MF - Mana Farm

A TUI to present DCC workloads dispatched to Kubernetes to artists, in a format they may be used to from traditional render farm tools.

Currently shows a list of pods (pod name, status, worker hostname, age), in a namespace "dcc", sorted by age. You can dive into pods to view their logs.
